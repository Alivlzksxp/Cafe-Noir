            In 2023, <strong>Caf√© Noir</strong> started as a heartfelt dream: a cozy place where neighbors become friends and coffee brings people together. Even as we have grown, our spirit remains grounded in community, sustainability, and the art of Filipino coffee.
        </p>
        <p>
            Every cup tells a story from the hardworking farmers in provinces like Benguet and Batangas, to the roasters, baristas, and guests. Our love for small batch roasting, responsible sourcing, and warm Filipino hospitality guides every moment we serve.
